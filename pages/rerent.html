            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;"><span class="blue">$4,320</span>. That’s how much money the average college student wastes every year
                paying for rent when they’re
                away on break. Though most students only need housing for at most 9 months out of the
                year, high demand and limited options allow landlords to keep leases at 12-months long in many college
                towns.
                Operational difficulties — such as needing to clean before and after a guest stays in your home — have made
                home-sharing out of reach for most college students. ReRent was created to take care of all these
                operational hassles and help students save money on housing.
                <br><br>
                Launched in 2018, ReRent has successfully booked out <span class="blue">1000+</span> total nights and has served
                <span class="blue">400+</span> guests. However, all prior services were handled manually — from listing
                on Airbnb to booking cleaners. Furthermore, ReRent had only been operating in the Yale area as there was no
                infrastructure to allow for expansion to other schools. FINISH BACKGROUND.

                students make the most of their housing? What infrastructure is needed to make home-sharing entirely
                painless for students?

            <p style="max-width: 24em;margin-right: 1em;">I had never formally run user interviews or conducted
                usability testing before. Getting to tackle the entire process, from recruiting users, to creating
                the scripts, to running the sessions was a great learning experience that taught me the art of truly
                listening to the user and digging deeper into the “why” of their insights.
