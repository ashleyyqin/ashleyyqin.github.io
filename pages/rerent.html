            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;"><span class="blue">$4,320</span>. That’s how much money the average college student wastes every year
                paying for rent when they’re
                away on break. Though most students only need housing for around 9 months out of the
                year, high demand and limited options allow landlords to keep leases at 12-months long in many college
                towns.
                Operational difficulties — such as needing to clean before and after a guest stays in your home — have made
                home-sharing out of reach for most college students. ReRent was created to take care of all these
                operational hassles and help students save money on housing.
                <br><br>
                ReRent has successfully booked out <span class="blue">1000+</span> total nights and has served
                <span class="blue">400+</span> guests since 2018. However, all prior services were handled manually —
                from helping students list their places on Airbnb to scheduling cleaners. Furthermore, ReRent had only been
                operating in the Yale area as there was no infrastructure to allow for expansion to other schools.
                <span class="blue">My role</span> at ReRent focused on these key questions:

                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">At the start of my internship, I was tasked with helping
                    develop a web application that gets data from the ReRenter — a.k.a. the student looking to rent out
                    their home — and distributes it to appropriate ReRent staff for them to handle. Automating this information
                    distribution would allow ReRent to reach a wider customer base by allowing staff to spend less time
                    going back and forth with ReRenters, and more time doing the actual work of creating listings on
                    Airbnb.
