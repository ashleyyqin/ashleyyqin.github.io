                    <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;"><span class="blue">$4,320</span>. That’s how much
                        money the average college student wastes every year
                        paying for rent when they’re
                        away on break. Though most students only need housing for around 9 months out of the
                        year, high demand and limited options allow landlords to keep leases at 12-months long in many
                        college
                        towns.
                        Operational difficulties — such as needing to clean before and after a guest stays in your home
                        — have made
                        home-sharing out of reach for most college students. ReRent was created to take care of all
                        these
                        operational hassles and help students save money on housing.

                        ReRent has successfully booked out <span class="blue">1000+</span> total nights and has served
                        <span class="blue">400+</span> guests since 2018. However, all prior services were handled
                        manually —
                        from helping students list their places on Airbnb to scheduling cleaners. This created a problem
                        where ReRent had the user demand to expand to other colleges, but lacked the infrastructure
                        to meet this demand.

                        <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">At the start of my internship, I was tasked
                            with helping
                            develop a web application that gets data from the ReRenter — a.k.a. the student looking to
                            rent out
                            their home — and distributes it to appropriate ReRent staff for them to handle. Automating
                            this information
                            distribution would allow ReRent to reach a wider customer base by allowing staff to spend
                            less time
                            going back and forth with ReRenters, and more time doing the actual work of creating
                            listings on
                            Airbnb.
