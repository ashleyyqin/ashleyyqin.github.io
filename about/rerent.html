            <p>$4,320. That’s how much money the average college student wastes every year paying for rent when they’re
                away on break. Though most students only need housing for at most 9 months out of the
                year, high demand and limited options allow landlords to keep leases at 12-months long in many college towns.
                With operational difficulties such as cleaning up before and after a guest stays in your home,
                home-sharing is generally out of reach for the average college student. ReRent was created to help
                students rent out their housing, hassle-free.

            <h2 style="margin-top: -2.4em;">Designing for a complex tool and unfamiliar user</h2>
            <div class="mb-4" style="display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;">
                <p style="max-width: 29em;margin-right: 1em;">I came into this internship with no prior knowledge or
                    experience in cloud computing and designing for more technical users, like DevOps or cloud
                    architects. Quickly learning how TA works and how different users typically manage their cloud
                    environments were definitely a challenge I initially faced, but after my research, I was able to
                    familiarize myself with this type of tool and user.</p><img src="/uploads/aws_ta.png" alt=""
                                                                                style="max-width: 10em;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 3em;">
            </div>
            <h2>Working from home, holding meetings, creating balanced schedule</h2>
            <div class="mb-4" style="display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;">
                <p style="max-width: 27em;">While I’m grateful that I was still able to work this internship in the
                    middle of the pandemic, there came challenges with me finding work-life balance, especially since my
                    team was mainly based in Seattle while I was 3 hours ahead in Ohio. Additionally, holding meetings
                    and being able to effectively communicate my ideas to many different audiences was a new experience.
                    Over time, I became better at understanding how to maximize my productivity at home and how to
                    communicate.</p><img src="/uploads/aws_homeoffice.jpg" alt=""
                                         style="max-width: 20em;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 1em;"></div>
            <h2>Accommodate for the 100%, optimize for the 80%</h2>
            <div class="mb-4" style="display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;">
                <p style="max-width: 29em;margin-right: 1em;">One piece of advice that stuck out to me from a design
                    critique was the idea of accommodating for the 100% but optimizing for 80%. Although I can’t
                    optimize the experience for all customers, I can aim to optimize for most. In my redesign of TA, I
                    overcame the challenge of ensuring this principle.</p><img src="/uploads/aws_10080.png" alt=""
                                                                               style="max-width: 10em;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-left: 3em;">

            <h2>How to formally conduct user interviews and usability testing</h2>
            <div class="mb-4" style="display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;">
                <p style="max-width: 24em;margin-right: 1em;">I had never formally run user interviews or conducted
                    usability testing before. Getting to tackle the entire process, from recruiting users, to creating
                    the scripts, to running the sessions was a great learning experience that taught me the art of truly
                    listening to the user and digging deeper into the “why” of their insights.</p><img

            <h2>Designing for accessibility</h2>
            <div class="mb-4" style="display: flex;flex-wrap: wrap;">
                <p style="max-width: 24em;margin-right: 1em;">I became more aware of accessibility guidelines for text
                    size, color, contrast ratios, and nesting elements.</p><img src="/uploads/aws_accessibility.png"
